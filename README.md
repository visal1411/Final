## Getting Started

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm
- Expo CLI
- TMDB API Key
- Appwrite Account & Project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone "URL"
cd sunset-movies
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_appwrite_project_id
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

5. Run on your device:
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device

## API Configuration

### TMDB API Setup

This app uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API for movie data. To get your API key:

1. Visit [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Request an API key
5. Copy the API key to your `.env` file

### Appwrite Setup

This app uses Appwrite for backend authentication and data storage.

1. Create an account at [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your Project ID and Endpoint from the project settings
4. Set up Authentication:
   - Go to Authentication in your Appwrite console
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
5. Add your Appwrite credentials to `.env`:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

## Theming

The app supports both light and dark themes. Users can toggle between themes in the Profile screen. The theme preference is persisted across app sessions.

## Authentication

The app uses Appwrite for authentication with the following features:

- **Email/Password Registration**: Create new user accounts
- **Login**
- **Session Management**
- **Logout**

### Authentication Flow

1. Users register with email, password, and name
2. Appwrite creates a user account and initiates a session
3. Session is stored and managed by AuthContext
4. Users can logout to terminate the session

## Architecture

### Authentication Service (`services/authen.js`)

The authentication service provides the following methods:

- `register(email, password, name)` - Create a new user account
- `login(email, password)` - Sign in existing user
- `logout()` - End current session

### State Management

The app uses React Context API for Global state management:

- **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state and user data
- **ColorThemeContext**: Handles light/dark theme switching
- **FavouriteContext**: Manages favorite movies list

### Dynamic route
Using dynamic route for movie details

### API usage
use fetch API for fetching data from TMDB and using CRUD(CRD) API for auth.

### API Endpoints
TMDB API:

- GET /discover/movie - Fetch popular movies sorted by popularity
- GET /search/movie - Search movies by title
- GET /movie/{id} - Get movie details by ID

Appwrite API:

- POST /account - User registration
- POST /account/sessions/ - User login
- DELETE /account/sessions/ - User logout
- GET /account - Get current authenticated user
